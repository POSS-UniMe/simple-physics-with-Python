    "### Discussion of the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fall time\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity we consider the body as a particle. We choose a point of the body and we represent the entire body by that point. If the particle moves along the $x$-axis with constant acceleration $a$ (**motion with constant acceleration**), the $x$ coordinate depends on the time $t$ through the relation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x = x_0 + v_0 t + \\dfrac{1}{2} a t^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we choose a vertical $x$-axis and the *downward* direction as positive. We take the origin $O$ at the starting point, so we will have $x_0 = 0$. Moreover, we have $v_0 = 0$, since the initial velocity of the body is zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we have \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x = \\dfrac{1}{2} a t^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the present case, the acceleration $a$ is substituted for the value of the acceleration $g$ due to gravity. In the equation for $x(t)$ we consider the **fall time**. The distance travelled is equal to the initial distance, $h$, between the body and the ground. As a consequence, the previous equation becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h = \\dfrac{1}{2} g t^2 \\hspace{2cm} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "from which it follows\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  t = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{2 h}{g}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ground impact speed\n",
    "\n",
    "If a particle moves with constant acceleration, the velocity changes according to the relation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v = v_0 + a t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "that, in the present case, becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v = g t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If for $t$ we consider the fall time, from this equation we obtain the magnitude of the velocity at the instant in which the body impacts on the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use symbolic calculation, we obtain\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v = g \\sqrt{\\dfrac{2 h}{g}} = \\sqrt{2 g h}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Another possible method\n",
    "\n",
    "The two equations concerning respectively the time dependence of the coordinate $x$ and that of the velocity $v$ for the case of a particle moving with constant acceleration, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x = x_0 + v_0 t + \\dfrac{1}{2} a t^2  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v = v_0 + a t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "it is possible to obtain the equation that relates the velocity to the position\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2 a (x-x_0) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the equation becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v^2 = 2 g (x-x_0) .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For $x-x_0 = h$ we obtain the velocity with which the body arrives to the ground, in fact $v^2 = 2 g h$ and finally\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v = \\sqrt{2 g h}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculations with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the equations that allow to calculate the fall time and the ground impact speed as a function of the initial height.\n",
    "\n",
