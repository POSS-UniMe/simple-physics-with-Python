### For interested users

For running the Python scripts contained in the Jupyter **Notebooks** of this collection even if Python and Jupyter are not installed on your device, you can use the **binder** environment online

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/POSS-UniMe/simple-physics-with-Python/HEAD)

We also suggest you to install the Anaconda package (Individual Edition), dowload a clone of the repository, and run the notebooks on your machine.
